# Stonehaven

Stonehaven, a small city nestled in the shadow of the Northern Mountains. Its three districts contrast the disparity between the affluent centre, the industrious middle ring, and the impoverished outer district.

> Stonehaven presents a starkly divided face. From the dusty, ramshackle poverty of the Outer District where hope seems scarce, one passes into the energetic, bustling Middle District filled with the sounds and smells of craft and commerce. Beyond that lies the Inner District, a realm of imposing architecture, manicured gardens, and orderly wealth, all set against the backdrop of the looming Northern Mountains. The air changes from district to district – from somber silence to industrial clamor to the refined quiet of prosperity.

## History

Stonehaven's history is etched in stone, a testament to the enduring legacy of its dwarven founders. Centuries ago, dwarven clans ventured into the Northern Mountains, seeking rich veins of ore and precious gems. They established a stronghold at the base of the mountains, a sanctuary from the dangers of the wilds and a centre for their mining operations. This stronghold, hewn from the living rock and fortified against attack, would become Stonehaven.

As the dwarves delved deeper into the mountains, their settlement grew in size and prosperity. The abundance of resources fuelled a thriving economy, attracting skilled artisans, merchants, and settlers from across the realm. Stonehaven became a melting pot of cultures, its dwarven foundations enriched by the contributions of its diverse inhabitants.

However, as the easily accessible resources in the mountains began to dwindle, Stonehaven's focus shifted from mining to trade. Its strategic location at the crossroads of major trade routes made it a vital hub for commerce, further increasing its wealth and influence. This shift also led to a growing disparity between the city's elite, who controlled the flow of trade, and the working class, who toiled in the ever-dwindling mines.

Over time, the power of the Merchant Guilds grew, eclipsing even that of the royal family of Stonehaven who faded from relevancy. The City Guard, once loyal to the crown, became increasingly beholden to the Merchant Guilds, enforcing their will and maintaining order within the city walls.

Despite the growing influence of the Merchant Guilds, Stonehaven's middle-class citizens enjoyed a period of relative peace and prosperity. The city's defences remained strong, its trade routes flourished, and its diverse population coexisted in a delicate balance. However, this stability was shattered with the controversial appointment of Commander Alfredo as the head of the City Guard. Under Alfredo's rule, the Guard became an instrument of oppression, particularly in the outer district, where his authoritarian policies further marginalized the city's most vulnerable residents.

This oppression, coupled with a string of mysterious disappearances, has created an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty in Stonehaven. Amidst this turmoil, a new organization known as The Hand of Mercy has emerged, offering aid and comfort to the city's most vulnerable residents. They provide healing services, shelter, and a sense of community, quickly gaining the trust and admiration of many. However, The Hand of Mercy is merely a façade for a darker purpose. They are, in fact, the cult led by Lucius Blackwood, using their benevolent guise to manipulate and indoctrinate new followers into their ranks. Their seemingly altruistic actions are merely a means to an end, furthering Lucius's ultimate goal of achieving apotheosis and establishing an undead kingdom.

## Culture

Stonehaven's culture is a blend of dwarven tradition and the diverse influences brought by settlers from across the realm. Hard work, craftsmanship, and a strong sense of community are highly valued, alongside a deep respect for tradition and a pragmatic approach to life. Dwarves still make up a significant portion of the population, but humans, halflings, gnomes, and even the occasional half-orc or elf can be found within the city walls, each contributing to its unique cultural tapestry.

### Districts

- **Outer District:** Life in the outer district is a constant struggle for survival, fostering a culture of resilience, resourcefulness, and tight-knit community bonds. Distrust of authority and a reliance on folk traditions and superstitions are prevalent, reflecting the district's isolation and the challenges faced by its residents, overlooked by the The Merchants' Guild.
- **Middle District:** The middle district is a bustling hub of commerce and industry, where a strong work ethic and a spirit of innovation thrive. Guilds and social organizations play a significant role, fostering a sense of belonging and providing support for artisans, merchants, and residents alike. Competition is fierce but tempered by a sense of fair play and a respect for those who excel in their craft.
- **Inner District:** The inner district is a world of wealth, privilege, and tradition, where dwarven heritage is proudly displayed and social status is paramount. A strict code of conduct governs interactions, and adherence to tradition is expected.

### Trade Routes

Stonehaven's strategic location at the crossroads of major trade routes has shaped its culture and contributed to its prosperity. The city serves as a vital link between the mountain settlements and the lowlands, facilitating the exchange of goods, resources, and ideas. This has led to the rise of The Merchants' Guild, whose influence extends throughout the city and shapes its political and social landscape. The influx of traders and travellers has also brought a diversity of cultures and perspectives, enriching Stonehaven's cultural tapestry but also creating tensions and conflicts.

### The City Guard

Renowned for their discipline and unwavering loyalty, the Stonehaven Guard is considered one of the most formidable forces in the region. The Merchants' Guild use The City Guard to suppress dissent and maintain its control over the city. Traditionally composed primarily of dwarves, the Guard has, in recent years, opened its ranks to other races, reflecting the city's growing diversity.

Under Commander Alfredo's leadership, however, the Guard has become more authoritarian and less tolerant of dissent, its presence a constant reminder of his iron-fisted rule. Many within the Guard have been swayed by Alfredo's rhetoric, emphasizing traditional values of honor, duty, and protection, which aligns with the Merchants' Guild's desire for order and stability.

## Geography

Stonehaven is nestled amidst the foothills of the Northern Mountains, a rugged range that dominates the horizon. The city itself is built on a series of tiered plateaus, rising gradually from the outer district to the imposing heights of the inner district. The terrain is rocky and uneven, with steep cliffs and winding paths connecting the different levels. Stonehaven's three districts are clearly demarcated by these natural formations and by the imposing walls that further divide the city.

The Stonehaven River flows through the heart of the city, its course winding through the middle district and eventually cascading down a series of waterfalls into a deep gorge that separates the city from the mountains. The river provides a vital source of water for the city and powers several mills and workshops along its banks.

To the south of Stonehaven, the landscape opens into rolling hills and fertile plains, where farms and vineyards dot the countryside. The imposing presence of the Northern Mountains to the north creates a natural barrier, limiting expansion in that direction and contributing to the city's tiered structure. This proximity to the mountains also influences Stonehaven's climate, bringing harsh winters with heavy snowfall and unpredictable spring thaws that can cause flooding in the lower districts. The summers are typically mild and pleasant, though occasional storms can sweep down from the mountains, bringing strong winds and torrential rain.

## Rumours

- The City Guard under Commander Alfredo is getting heavy-handed, especially down in the outer district. Some say he answers more to the Guilds than the people.
- Folks are vanishing again, just whispers mind you. Not like the big storm years back, but unsettling. Some blame restless spirits from the Catacombs.
- That Hand of Mercy group seems nice, helping folks in the outer district, but where do they get their funding? Seems suspicious.
- If you need something _really_ hard to find, Zac Shadows over at the [[The Crooked Quill]] is your man... if you don't mind getting your hands dirty.
- Heard the lower mines are played out, dwarves are barely pulling anything these days. Might be why things are so tense with the Guilds.
