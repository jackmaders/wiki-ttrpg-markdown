# Sandport

Sandport, a bustling port town nestled against a cliffside, thrives under the protection of the Moonlight's Blessing, a sacred sapphire that safeguards its inhabitants and fuels its vibrant seafaring culture.

> As you approach Sandport, the air grows thick with the salty tang of the sea, and the crash of waves against the shore provides a constant rhythm, punctuated by the cries of gulls circling overhead. The town unfolds before you, built on a tiered, sloping hillside that descends towards the bustling harbour. Houses and shops perch on different levels, connected by winding staircases carved into the rock. Fishing nets hang drying in the sun, draping between buildings. The cobblestone streets bustle with townsfolk going about their daily business, and the sounds of shouting merchants mingle with the lively chatter spilling from the Tipsy Tankard and the gentle creaking of fishing boats swaying in the sea breeze.

## History

Sandport's story began with devout followers of God of the Full Moon, led by a powerful cleric who crafted the Moonlight's Blessing and built The Moonlight Chapel. The sapphire's potent magic provided strong protection for the fledgling settlement, shielding it from dangers both at sea and inland. As generations passed and the town prospered, the initial fervent devotion to the God of the Full Moon gradually waned, though he remained relevant in Sandport culture.

With Sandport's focus shifting towards sea trade as its primary economic driver, the Moonlight's Blessing power began to diminish over time, leaving the town unknowingly vulnerable. This weakening manifested in several troubling omens: fishermen began disappearing at sea, smugglers began using the northern cove as a hidden base, and sickness spread among the farm animals.

Eighty years ago, a devastating storm struck Sandport—a disaster unlike any the town had ever seen. The storm caused significant damage and loss of life, and it also wiped out the smugglers operating from the northern cove, effectively erasing their presence and activities from local memory. In the aftermath of this tragedy, the Wavecrest Festival was established. This four-yearly event served as a way to rekindle the town's devotion to God of the Full Moon and recharge the Moonlight's Blessing, bringing renewed prosperity and protection to Sandport.

Today, however, the memory of the great storm is fading with each passing year. Father Iris works tirelessly to prevent another such tragedy, constantly reminding the townsfolk of their reliance on the God of the Full Moon's protection. He and Mayoress Helena Barrow must carefully balance the town's spiritual needs with its growing economic interests, ensuring the Wavecrest Festival remains a central part of Sandport’s identity.

## Culture

Sandport is a melting pot of seafarers and traders, creating a vibrant and welcoming culture. The townsfolk are known for their open-mindedness and hospitality, readily accepting travellers from all walks of life. Stories and goods from distant lands flow through the port, enriching the town's culture with diverse influences. This welcoming atmosphere fosters a sense of camaraderie and mutual respect, making Sandport a haven for those seeking adventure or a fresh start.

### Moonlight's Blessing

Moonlight's Blessing is a large, teardrop-shaped sapphire, flawlessly polished and nestled within an ancient silver frame. Intricate carvings of waves and sea creatures adorn the frame, worn smooth by centuries of reverent handling. The sapphire itself glows with a soft, internal light, pulsing gently like the heartbeat of the ocean.

Legend tells that God of the Full Moon himself gifted this sapphire to Sandport's founders, promising her divine protection so long as they remained faithful. The gem acts as a reservoir, gathering and storing the divine energy generated by the town's unwavering worship.

When storms rage, the sapphire's gentle pulse quickens, its light intensifying to a brilliant blue. A palpable sense of calm descends upon the waters encircling Sandport. The winds seem to bend and weave around the town's boundaries, and the waves, though powerful, crash harmlessly against the shore, as if guided by an unseen hand. It is said that the very air around the town is imbued with a tranquil aura, soothing the savage instincts of wild creatures

Within Sandport's limits, the divine magic of other gods feels diminished, their influence subtly muted. Prayers are still heard, but their answers lack their usual potency and immediacy. Healers find their spells less efficacious, and clerics struggle to fully channel their deities' power.

### Wavecrest Festival

The Wavecrest Festival, a tradition as old as Sandport itself, is a time of both joyous celebration and solemn reverence. Held every four years, it marks a period of reflection on the blessings of the past and a heartfelt plea for continued protection in the future. It commemorates the founding of Sandport and the legendary pact made with the God of the Full Moon, who gifted the town with the Moonlight's Blessing. The festival serves to reaffirm this pact and to replenish the artefact's protective energies.

The first day is a vibrant explosion of music, laughter, and feasting. Stalls overflowing with local delicacies—from freshly caught, grilled fish to honey-drizzled pastries—line the streets. Games of skill and chance fill the town square, attracting both young and old. The air is filled with the sounds of music and merriment, a joyous celebration of life and the bounty of the sea.

The second day is a more religious affair, dedicated to honouring the God of the Full Moon. The townsfolk gather at The Moonlight Chapel, where Father Iris leads a solemn ceremony. Prayers are offered for protection from the sea's wrath, and offerings of flowers and seashells are placed before the altar. The ceremony culminates in the recharging of the Moonlight's Blessing, a moment of profound spiritual significance for the entire town. The air is thick with the scent of incense and the murmur of prayers, a powerful testament to Sandport's unwavering faith.

## Geography

Sandport clings to a rugged stretch of coastline, a brief reprieve from dramatic seaside cliffs that rise sharply from the crashing waves to the north and south of the town. The town itself is built on a gentle slope towards the bustling harbour, creating a tiered effect with houses and roads perched on different levels. Winding staircases, carved into the rock, connect these subtle shifts in elevation, giving the town a unique, almost precarious charm as buildings seem stacked upon one another against the imposing backdrop of the cliffs.

Inland, the landscape shifts dramatically. To the north, the dark and mysterious expanse of the Darkwood Forest looms, while to the west, rolling hills and fertile farmlands stretch as far as the eye can see. The winding Silverstream River flows down from these hills, emptying into the sea just south of Sandport, providing the town with a vital source of fresh water.
